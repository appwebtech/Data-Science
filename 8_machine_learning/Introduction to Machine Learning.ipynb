    "**Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look. \n",

    "### What is Machine Learning used for?\n",
    "* Fraud detection \n",
    "* Web search results \n",
    "* Real-time ads on web pages\n",
    "* credit scoring and next-best offers.\n",
    "* Prediction  of equipment failures.\n",
    "* New pricing models \n",

    "There are 3 main types of Machine Learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Supervised Learning\n",
    "* You have labeled data and are trying to predict a label based off of known features. *eg a piece of equipment could have data points labeled either 'F' (failed) or 'R' (runs)* \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "* You have unlabeled data and are trying to group together similar data points based off of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Reinforcement Learning \n",
    "* Algorithms learn to perform an action from experience. Often used for robotics, gaming and navigation. \n",
