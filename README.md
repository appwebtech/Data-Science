## DATA SCIENCE WITH PYTHON

I was watching a YouTube video about some data modelling which reminded me that I had some materials that I was using to learn data science using Python.

I used Anaconda Navigator which ran my environment with Jupyter Notebook as it could render models effectively using numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

I didn't go past Machine Learning (ML) and Linear Regression as that was beyond the scope of what I wanted to achieve, but someday I may venture in those waters.

Hopefully GitHub with recreate the models correctly, I'm not sure whether it can support graphics but I know it can read **ipynb** file extensions.

If there will be hitches with display, I recommend downloading the files and working with them locally.

Lastly, I will review and update the codebase in areas which may have evolved with different library stacks.
